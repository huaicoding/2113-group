Process: 
           1.Shuffle the cards
           2.Assign the two cards to the player
           3.Assign the two cards to the banker, the first card to be assigned needs to be shown to the player
           4.If the first card of the banker is 'A', the player will be asked whether he/she want to buy insurance
           5.The player could choose 'Surrender', 'Double' or 'Split', etc.
           6.The player choose whether countiue to hit or stand
           7.If the banker has less than 17 points, he has to add until he exceeds or equals 17 points
           8.If neither the player nor the banker have more than 21 points, compare the point sizes and let the person with higher point win and get the bet
           9.If the banker has more than 21 points and the player has less than 21 points, the player will win the bet 
           10.If the player has more than 21 points, the player will lose the bet directly
           


Point Calculation: 
           'A' will be considered as 1 point or 11 points
           '2'-'10' will be considered as 2-10 points
           'J','Q' and 'K' will be considered as 10 points
           For the initial two cards, if one of the cards is an 'A', then it will be treated as 11 points. 
           If the total number of points is greater than 21 points after adding other cards, the 'A' will be treated as 1 points.
           If the sum of the points is great than 21 points, it will be treated as 'Bust'


Special Rules: 
       Insurance: 
           When the banker's first card is an 'A', the player could choose to buy insurance with half of the bet.
           If the banker is not a blackjack, the insurance money is immediately forfeited. If it is a blackjack, the player will gain the twice of the insurance.

       Double: 
           The player could choose to increase his/her initial bet by 100%.
           However, the player can only get one more card after double the bet.

       Split: 
           If the player's first two cards have the same number of points, the player could choose to split the cards and creat two hands from a strating hand.
           Each new hand gets another card so that the player has two starting hands. This requires an additional bet on the second hand.
           The two hands are played out independently, and the bet on each hand is won or lost independently.

       Black Jack -- 21 points: 
           If the sum of the player's first two cards is 21 points, it is a 'Black Jack'. The player wins immediaterly.
           A 'Black Jack' beats any hand, even one with the point of 21

Random number
    We generate a random number to randomly select the card from the pile each time the player and banker hit cards. The range of the random number will decrease after hitting cards.
Data
    We use a binary tree to store the whole card deck. After each random number is generated, the program will search for the corresponding tree node and delete that node. 

    Besides, we use string vectors to store player’s cards and banker’s cards. 
Dynamic memory management
    The binary tree we use to store the card deck applies dynamic memory management. 
File input/output
    After each game, we will record the status of the game in the file “cash_out_result.txt”, such as games the player wins, games the player plays, and the cash the player wins/lost. And the player can choose whether to see the game status, which we will apply File-Input.
Program codes in multiple files
    We split the program into several files, including player.h, banker.h, and AllocationSystem.h. Player.h stores the functions related to the player and banker.h stores the functions related to the banker. AllocationSystem.h mainly served to allocate cards to the player and the banker randomly. 

--------------------------------------------------------non-standard_libraries-----------------------------------------------------------

List of non-standard libraries:
#include <'iostream'> // used to input and output

#include <'string'> // used to use data type string

#include <'sstream'> // used to support function istringstream

#include <'vector'> // to support the usage of vector

#include <'time.h'> // used to generate random number

#include <'fstream'> // used to support file in/out

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To compile the codes, you should tape “make” in the terminal, and the system will compile the main file and head files together.

As for the execution, you may type “./black_jack” in the terminal and follow the instructions of the program.
